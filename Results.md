The SVM classifiers are trained using Gaussian, radial basis function kernel. The optimal values of kernel parameter gamma and penalty parameter C are chosen based on grid search with C and gamma varying from 10-3 to 103 in multiples of 10.
The pair (C,ÔÅß) is selected which resulted in the highest classification accuracy on test data.

Table shows the final average accuracies obtained for each non words, words and sentences.
