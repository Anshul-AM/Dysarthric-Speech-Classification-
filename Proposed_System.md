Uses TORGO database for classification.
Uses QCP GIF method for extracting glottal parameters.
Uses openSMILE toolkit for extracting acoustic features.
In this work, SVMs are used as classifiers.
Separate classifiers are trained using reduced and non-reduced feature sets for openSMILE, glottal features and their combination.
