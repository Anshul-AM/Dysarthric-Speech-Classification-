To develop the dysarthric speech classification system, the TORGO database is utilized.
This database contains speech recordings from seven patients (three females and four males), diagnosed with cerebral palsy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and speech recordings from seven healthy control speakers (three females and four males). The age range of patients is from 16 years to 50 years.
The database includes speech signals in three categories, namely non-words, words and sentences.
In this study, utterances in all three speech signal categories of TORGO, recorded by an array microphone with 16-kHz sampling, are used.
